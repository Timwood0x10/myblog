# ares Series: Building Your Own Agent Framework When You're Bored

> I've always believed the best way to learn is to build your own wheel.

## Prologue

This is the opening post of what will become a series. The kind of writing where thoughts run free. I asked the admins if I could promote my own project — they said yes, so here I am, shamelessly self-promoting :rofl:

Let's start with some small talk.

AI has moved fast in the last two years. Agents are everywhere now. But here's the question: **how do *you* learn about agents?**

In this era of the AI revolution, not learning means falling behind. But learning? Work is already exhausting enough without forcing yourself to study new stuff after hours. My initial thought was: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. But then I thought: **screw it, I'll just design my own.**

## A Quick Look Back

I'm not exactly the model employee who quietly churns out code, hhh. So yeah, my career hasn't been smooth sailing :rofl:

My first real encounter with agents was last year when I co-founded a **Music AI** startup with a friend. I designed the architecture myself, hand-crafted a music tool that could split audio by track and process each layer independently. What I wanted wasn't your typical AIGC — it was **restoration and enhancement**. Think of how AI can turn old movies into 4K — we wanted to perfect audio, find the dissonant parts, analyze them, and suggest fixes.

I had the LLM designed and trained — using MLX and PyTorch. But the capital market dried up, and the project died on the vine.

That frustration carried over. I kept learning, building two interactive visualization tools along the way:

- [**Model_explorer**](https://github.com/just-for-dream-0x10/Model_explorer) — interactive visualizations of ML math fundamentals
- [**Transformer_explorer**](https://github.com/just-for-dream-0x10/Transformer_explorer) — interactive Transformer internals

Both were built from my personal study notes. Then I shipped a Rust project to crates.io — good reception, even the foreign devs loved it.

And then came the main character of today's story: **ares**.

## Why Go?

I'm a backend developer by trade. I know Rust and Go.

**Python was ruled out first.** Not because it's bad — but it never felt quite right. The look, the feel, especially the concurrency story: slow, messy, painful.

Then it was a toss-up between Rust and Go:

- **Rust**: I love it. But the compile times are a dealbreaker for rapid iteration.
- **Go**: Clean, blazing fast, concurrency built into its DNA.

There was another reason: some HR person said I didn't know Go, that I had no Go projects. As a developer with professional pride — **I had to choose Go and silence every doubt.**

## From Python Pain to Go Rebirth

Like many others, I started with Python. Built a local knowledge base with vector database + Ollama.

The first time it worked, I was genuinely excited: document chunking, embedding, ingestion, querying... Ollama could actually answer questions about my local notes!

The excitement didn't last.

When I tried to add **tool calling, multi-step reasoning, cross-session memory, multi-agent collaboration** — everything fell apart. Python under concurrency was slow and messy. Memory management was a disaster. Workflow logic devolved into spaghetti code of callbacks and state machines. Every time I wanted to change the flow (add failover, add human-in-the-loop), I had to rewrite half the codebase. Debugging long-running tasks was like chasing ghosts.

I knew: **there has to be a better way.**

Go's simplicity, raw performance, and built-in concurrency primitives caught my eye. So I decided: rewrite the entire agent system from scratch in Go.

**Shedding old baggage, I designed my own agent framework** — that's the origin story of ares.

I started with the basics: LLM calls, simple RAG. But this time, everything felt different:

- **Goroutines** — concurrent agents that are naturally fast and lightweight
- **Strong types + clean interfaces** — designed clearer abstractions from day one
- **Channels and Context** — reliable workflow orchestration and cancellation

## Key Features

As the project matured, I added the features I always wanted:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dynamic DAG Workflows** | Execution graphs built and modified at runtime — no more hardcoding |
| **Memory Distillation** | Long-term memory auto-summarized and compressed — agents don't drown in context |
| **AHP (Agent Hierarchical Protocol)** | Clear communication, delegation, and collaboration between agents |
| **Leader + Sub-Agent with Failover** | If the Leader dies, sub-agents pick up seamlessly |
| **Pluggable Vector Stores** | PostgreSQL pgvector, Qdrant, etc. Core ops <1µs with zero-alloc hot paths |
| **MCP Protocol** | Native Model Context Protocol support for dynamic tool discovery |
| **Event System & Flight Recorder** | Every agent action becomes an immutable record — state recovery, audit trails |
| **Chaos Engineering** | 14 chaos actions (kill_leader, network_partition, tool_timeout, etc.) randomly injected into production agents to validate anti-fragility; support for survival mode (30 min sustained random failures) and scenario orchestration (YAML-defined multi-step chaos experiments); 3D weighted scoring (Availability 40%, Recovery 30%, Consistency 30%) with Welch's t-test regression |
| **Autonomous Evolution** | Agent strategies self-evolve via a dual-path design: the DreamCycle path evaluates mutated candidates through Arena regression testing (two-stage: Quick Reject 5 rounds → Full Eval 50 rounds) to select optimal strategies; the Genome GA path operates at zero token cost on pre-computed scores — selection (truncation/tournament/roulette), crossover (uniform/multi-point/half-split), and mutation (70% parameter / 15% prompt / 15% tool), with automatic score degradation triggering (15% threshold) |

## The Craziest Feature: Agent Assassination

I built something a little unhinged — **a feature that randomly assassinates a running agent to see if it can truly resurrect**.

```
2026/06/14 19:46:29 INFO arena: killed agent id=agent-1
2026/06/14 19:46:29 INFO orchestrator: agent killed, resurrecting id=agent-1 name="Architecture Review"
2026/06/14 19:46:29 INFO orchestrator: agent started id=agent-6 name="Architecture Review"
2026/06/14 19:46:29 INFO orchestrator: resuming agent from step id=agent-6 resume_from=agent-1 start_step=4 total_steps=3
```

Five agents running in parallel. Randomly kill a few of them. The Orchestrator automatically resurrects them and resumes progress — MCP data, conversation context, execution steps all seamlessly restored. This is still Beta (not merged to master), but the results are already impressive.

## Final Thoughts

If you're going through a rough patch, I hope this story encourages you. **Be kind to yourself, keep shipping, embrace change.**
